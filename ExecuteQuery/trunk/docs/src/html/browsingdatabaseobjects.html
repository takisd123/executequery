    <td><p>Expanding a connection node within the Connections pane upon
        successful connection to that database reveals the underlying database
        structure and associated objects.</p>
        <p>Selection of any expanded node will reveal information about that
        particular node either as the parent of further child nodes or specific
        information relating to the selection.</p>
        <p>For example, selection of a schema node with obvious children
        displays within the browser's central pane a list of available objects
        and their type. Selection of a particular object such as a database
        table will reveal that table's meta data including column names,
        constraints, indexes, references and where applicable the data 
        itself.</p>
        <p>Right-clicking on any expanded node displays the browser's popup menu
        providing specific actions to occur on that selected node or connection.
        This includes reloading the selected node, exporting the node's data (in
        the case of tables), recycling the connection and closing the 
        connection.</p>

    <td><p>The default catalog or schema is defined by the nature of the
        connection being made to the database. When querying the database for
        it's meta data and any objects that may be available, the driver will
        often return a larger picture of the database than is required for our
        purposes - that is it may return ALL catalogs and schemas and not just
        the one we have authenticated and connected to (eg. the standard 
        information_schema will often be visible).</p>
        <p>Where this is the case, the default catalog or schema is that schema
        that the connection is actually made against. Objects that are a part of
        this default catalog or schema are displayed in greater detail and allow
        for <a href="editingdatabaseobjects.html">editing</a> within the 
        browser's central pane. The default catalog or schema will be marked 
        with '(connected)' beside the relevant node.</p>
        <p>Objects outside the default are still available but will be shown
        in a slightly more condensed format.</p>
