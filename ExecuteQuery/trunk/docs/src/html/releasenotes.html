--------

This releases continues the first stage of planned source code refactoring and
has been lighter on the feature addition list beyond critical bug fixes. There
remains much more to do here, but with most core design changes now in place the 
upcoming release changes will focus on feature enhancements and additions.

Thanks to those who submitted bugs and suggestions. Keep them coming!


License:

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under 
certain conditions. See the GNU General Public License for details. 

Deployment Environment:
-----------------------
At present the recommended Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE) version is at least 
1.5.0.

This program has been tested under JRE version 1.5.0 (and 1.6.0) on the 
following platforms:

   -- Windows versions 2000, XP and Vista
   -- Solaris8, Solaris9 and Solaris10
   -- Various flavours of Linux


Startup files:
--------------
The application may be started by using the executable file eq.exe (Windows 
only) or the Unix shell scripts eq.sh.

Alternatively you may simply execute the Java archive eq.jar from the 
installation directory using your installed Java 1.5 runtime environment.


Source Code:
------------
Source code is available for download directly from the download link at
executequery.org (where this program was downloaded). The source file is 
typically named executequery-src-<version>.tar.gz.

Source code snapshots are also available from the Execute Query project
on sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/executequery. Source may be
checked out using svn as shown below:

svn co https://executequery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/executequery/trunk executequery

The source requires Java version 1.5 to build successfully. If building under 
Java version 1.6 or later you will need to uncomment the new java.sql.Connection
implementation methods in the class org.executequery.datasource.PooledConnection
otherwise it will not build under v1.6+.

If you are interested in a particular feature but can not locate it within the 
code, please contact myself at the above address and you will be pointed in the 
right direction.

Note: In line with the significant redesign of much of Execute Query, the 
opportunity was taken to refactor much of the source code. Packages have been 
reorganised and many classes renamed, merged or removed. This process is ongoing
and will continue across the next few versions.
