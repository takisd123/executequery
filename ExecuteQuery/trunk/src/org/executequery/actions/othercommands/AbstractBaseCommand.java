/**
 * This is the base class for the action library. All
 * actions will inherit from this class. The CommandAction
 * defines a generic implementation of actionPerformed.
 * Here actionPerformed simply calls the execute method
 * on its command object.<br>
 * A developer can use this type directly by passing in
 * the command, string, and action. However, convenience
 * implementations are available that already provide the
 * string and icon. The developer simply needs to provide
 * the proper command.<br>
