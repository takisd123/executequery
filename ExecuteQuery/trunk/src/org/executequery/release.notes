Deployment Environment:
-----------------------
At present the recommended Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE) version is at least
1.6.0.

This program has been tested under JRE version 1.6.0 on the
following platforms:

   -- Windows versions 2000, XP and Vista, 7
   -- Solaris8, Solaris9, Solaris10 and OpenSolaris
   -- Various flavours of Linux


Startup files:
--------------
The application may be started by using the executable file eq.exe (Windows
only) or the Unix shell scripts eq.sh.

Alternatively you may simply execute the Java archive eq.jar from the
installation directory using your installed Java 1.6 runtime environment.


Source Code:
------------
Source code is available for download directly from the download link at
executequery.org (where this program was downloaded). The source file is
typically named executequery-src-<version>.tar.gz.

Source code snapshots are also available from the Execute Query project
on sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/executequery. Source may be
checked out using svn as shown below:

svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/executequery/code/trunk executequery

The source requires Java version 1.6 to build successfully.

If you are interested in a particular feature but can not locate it within the
code, please contact myself at the above address and you will be pointed in the
right direction.

Note: In line with the significant redesign of much of Execute Query, the
opportunity was taken to refactor much of the source code. Packages have been
reorganised and many classes renamed, merged or removed. This process is ongoing
and will continue across the next few versions.
