/**
 * The TokenTypes interface defines the integer constants representing
 * different types of tokens, for use with any languages.  The constants are
 * used in symbols to represent the types of similar tokens, and in scanners as
 * scanner states, and in highlighters to determine the colour or style of
 * tokens.  There is also an array typeNames of textual names, indexed by type,
 * for descriptive purposes.
 *
 * <p>The UNRECOGNIZED constant (zero) is for tokens which are completely
 * unrecognized, usually consisting of a single illegal character.  Other error
 * tokens are represented by negative types, where -t represents an incomplete
 * or malformed token of type t.  An error token usually consists of the
 * maximal legal substring of the source text.
