/** 
 * A convenience class providing a simple component
 * to display text within a rectangle achieving the same
 * effect as displayed when disabling a <code>JTextField</code>
 * under the Metal L&F. This will provide a common 'disabled'
 * component across all L&Fs that remains lightweight and does
 * not feature or require those methods as would be available
 * using a <code>JTextField</code>.
 *
 * <p>Some limitations have been deliberately introduced. The
 * component height will always be 24px. The width is determined
 * as specified or by the layout manager. In any case, This
 * component's size should not require any modification given its
 * limited design and purpose.
