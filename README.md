ExecuteQuery
============

ExecuteQuery is a database query and introspection utility. Written entirely in 
Java, ExecuteQuery uses the flexibility and power and provided by Java Database 
Connectivity API (JDBC), to provide a simple and consistent way to interact with 
almost any database from simple queries to table creation and import/export of 
an entire schema/catalog's data.

ExecuteQuery was started many (many!) years ago to solve the basic problem at 
the time of jumping between different database applications and having to learn
different tool sets and techniques for interaction and development. Beginning as
not much more than a simple query and result application, ExecuteQuery slowly 
evolved to include a number of useful features supporting software developers 
and database administrators. 

Further information on ExecuteQuery and its features can be found at 
http://executequery.org with screenshots at http://executequery.org/screenshots

## Running ExecuteQuery

ExecuteQuery requires a minimum of Java 7 installed.

Current version build and installable packages (as well as bundled source 
archives) can be downloaded from http://executequery.org/download

ExecuteQuery is available in the following package formats:

* OS independant installable JAR file
* ZIP archive
* DEB package
* Gzip archive
* Gzip source archive

## Building ExecuteQuery from source

ExecuteQuery requires at least a Java 7 JDK installed and the current build uses
ant which can be downloaded from http://ant.apache.org

Run the build by simply executing `ant` from the source directory. 

A build should only take seconds and the resulting `eq.jar` file will be found 
in the current directory ready to use.

Start ExecuteQuery by either using the relevant start script for your OS - 
`eq.sh` or `eq.exe`. Mac users are probably best installing from the JAR 
installer and then incorporating any snapshot changes from this source after as 
this will provide the correct structure within `/Applications` including the 
correct `icns` icon file for ExecuteQuery.

Alternatively, simply start as follows:

```
  $ java -jar eq.jar
```
